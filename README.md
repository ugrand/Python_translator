Creating a complete language translator software involves several components, including user interface, translation engine, and integration with translation APIs. Here's a simplified example of how you could create a basic language translator software using Python:

1. User Interface:
You can use a library like Tkinter for a simple GUI or Flask/Django for a web-based interface.

2. Translation Engine:
For this example, let's use the googletrans library, which is a Python wrapper around the Google Translate API. Install it using pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1.

3. Code Implementation:
Here's a basic implementation using Tkinter for the GUI and the googletrans library for translation:
